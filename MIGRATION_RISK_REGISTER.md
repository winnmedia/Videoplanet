## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 游댮 Critical Risks (Immediate Action Required)

#### R001: State Management Migration Data Loss
- **Description**: Redux state restructuring could corrupt or lose user data
- **Triggers**: State shape changes, selector updates, migration script failures
- **Business Impact**: User data loss, session corruption, potential customer churn
- **Technical Impact**: Application crashes, inconsistent UI state, data recovery needed

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Pre-Migration**: Create complete state backup mechanism
2. **During Migration**: Implement dual-state running (old + new simultaneously)
3. **Validation**: Automated state integrity checks before each deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time state health monitoring with alerts

**Contingency Plans**:
- **Immediate**: Feature flag to disable new state management
- **Short-term**: Automated rollback to previous state structure  
- **Long-term**: Manual data recovery from backups with user communication

**Success Criteria**: Zero reports of data loss, all user sessions preserved

---

#### R002: Breaking API Changes During Backend Integration
- **Description**: Frontend-backend communication failures due to contract changes
- **Triggers**: API schema updates, endpoint modifications, authentication changes
- **Business Impact**: Application functionality breakdown, user cannot access features
- **Technical Impact**: 500 errors, failed requests, broken user workflows

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **API Versioning**: Implement v1/v2 endpoints with gradual migration
2. **Contract Testing**: Automated tests between frontend/backend contracts
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain old endpoints during transition period
4. **Communication**: Structured API change review process

**Contingency Plans**:
- **Immediate**: API gateway routing to stable endpoints
- **Short-term**: Rollback to previous API version
- **Long-term**: Emergency hotfix deployment with data migration

**Success Criteria**: Zero API-related service disruptions, <1% increase in error rates

---

#### R010: Team Burnout from Extended Migration Period
- **Description**: 24-week migration timeline causing team exhaustion and turnover
- **Triggers**: Consistent overtime, complex technical challenges, unclear progress
- **Business Impact**: Developer turnover, knowledge loss, project delays
- **Technical Impact**: Code quality degradation, increased bugs, technical debt

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Workload Management**: Strict sprint capacity limits, no weekend work
2. **Progress Visibility**: Clear milestone celebrations and progress communication
3. **Skill Development**: Frame migration as learning opportunity with certifications
4. **Support**: Regular 1:1s, mental health resources, flexible working

**Contingency Plans**:
- **Immediate**: Resource reallocation, timeline adjustment
- **Short-term**: Contractor/consultant support for critical path items
- **Long-term**: Phased approach with extended timeline if needed

**Success Criteria**: Zero unplanned turnover, team satisfaction scores >80%

### 游리 Medium Risks (Monitor & Prepare)

#### R003: User Session Interruption During Auth Migration
- **Mitigation**: Dual token support, gradual cutover, session preservation
- **Monitoring**: Authentication success rates, user complaints
- **Escalation**: If auth failure rate >0.5%, immediate rollback

#### R004: Development Velocity Drop During Learning Curve  
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training, pair programming, documentation
- **Monitoring**: Sprint velocity, story point completion rates
- **Escalation**: If velocity drops >40%, extend timeline and add resources

#### R005: Third-party Integration Breakage
- **Mitigation**: Integration testing, service health checks, gradual cutover
- **Monitoring**: External service response times, error rates
- **Escalation**: If any integration fails >5 minutes, activate backup plans

---

### 游릭 Low Risks (Monitor Only)

#### R008: SEO Impact from Routing Changes
- **Monitoring**: Search ranking positions, organic traffic metrics
- **Escalation**: If organic traffic drops >10%, implement URL redirects

#### R009: Bundle Size Increase
- **Monitoring**: Build size analysis, Core Web Vitals
- **Escalation**: If bundle increases >20%, implement code splitting

- **Actions**: Emergency team assembly, contingency plan activation, executive notification

### Level 3: Executive Response
- **Trigger**: Critical business impact or multiple red risks
- **Response Time**: Within 30 minutes  
- **Actions**: Go/no-go decision, resource reallocation, customer communication

---

## Risk Communication Plan

### Weekly Risk Review
- **Attendees**: Team leads, product owner, project manager
- **Agenda**: Risk status updates, new risk identification, mitigation effectiveness
- **Output**: Updated risk register, action items, escalation decisions

### Monthly Stakeholder Report
