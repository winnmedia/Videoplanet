## Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment Approach

#### Phase Deployment Process
1. **Staging Validation**
   - Deploy slice to staging environment
   - Run full test suite including E2E
   - Performance validation
   - Security scanning

2. **Canary Release**
   - Deploy to 10% of production users
   - Monitor key metrics for 24 hours
   - Collect user feedback and error rates
   - Automated rollback triggers

3. **Full Deployment**  
   - Graduate to 100% traffic
   - Monitor for 48 hours
   - Document any issues and resolutions

### Feature Flag Strategy
- **Gradual Rollout**: Each major slice protected by feature flags
- **User Segments**: Beta users get early access to new features
- **Emergency Shutoff**: Instant disable capability for critical issues
- **A/B Testing**: Compare old vs new implementations

### Rollback Procedures

#### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Error rate >2% above baseline
- Page load time >5 seconds
- API failure rate >1%
- User session failure >0.5%

#### Manual Rollback Process
1. **Immediate**: Feature flag disable (< 30 seconds)
2. **Application**: Previous version deployment (< 5 minutes)  
3. **Database**: State rollback if needed (< 15 minutes)
4. **Full**: Complete environment restoration (< 30 minutes)

#### Rollback Validation
- Health checks on all critical paths
- User authentication verification
- Data integrity validation
- Third-party service connectivity

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature: FSD Architecture Migration
As a development team  
I want to migrate to Feature-Sliced Design architecture  
So that we can develop features in parallel with minimal conflicts

#### Scenario: Layer Boundary Enforcement
```gherkin
Given the FSD architecture is implemented
When a developer tries to import from a higher layer
Then the ESLint should block the import with a clear error message
And the build should fail
And the developer should see guidance on the correct import path

Example:
  Given I am in a "feature" layer component
  When I try to import from "widgets" or "app" layers  
  Then I should get error "features cannot import from widgets/app layers"
```

#### Scenario: Public API Usage
```gherkin
Given any FSD slice is implemented
When external code needs to import from the slice
Then only exports from index.ts (barrel exports) should be accessible
And direct imports to internal files should be blocked by linter
And all public APIs should be documented

Example:
  Given the "user" entity exists
  When I want to access user selectors
  Then I should import from "entities/user" (barrel)
  And NOT from "entities/user/model/selectors"
```

#### Scenario: State Management Migration
```gherkin
Given the current Redux state structure
When migrating to FSD state management
Then domain state should move to entities layer
And temporary/form state should stay in features layer
And no business logic should exist in UI components
And all state changes should be testable independently

Example:
  Given user authentication state
  When implementing FSD structure
  Then user data should be in "entities/user/model"
  And login form state should be in "features/auth/login/model"
```

### Feature: Testing Infrastructure  
As a developer
I want comprehensive testing tools
So that I can practice TDD and maintain code quality

#### Scenario: TDD Workflow Support
```gherkin
Given the testing infrastructure is set up
When I start developing a new feature
Then I should be able to write failing tests first
And run tests in watch mode during development
And see clear test failure messages with debugging info
And mock external dependencies easily

Example:
  Given I want to add a "create project" feature
  When I write tests before implementation
  Then tests should fail initially
  And guide me toward the correct implementation
```

#### Scenario: Component Testing
```gherkin
Given any UI component is implemented
When testing user interactions
Then I should test behavior, not implementation
And use accessibility queries (getByRole, getByLabelText) as primary selectors
And mock only external dependencies, not component internals
And achieve meaningful coverage of user scenarios

Example:  
  Given a LoginForm component
  When testing login functionality
  Then I should test "user can log in with valid credentials"
  And NOT "useState was called with correct parameters"
```

### Feature: Performance Requirements
As an end user
I want fast loading and responsive interactions  
So that I can work efficiently with the application

#### Scenario: Initial Page Load Performance
```gherkin
Given any page in the application
When a user visits the page for the first time
Then the page should load within 3 seconds on 3G connection
And show meaningful content within 1.5 seconds  
And be interactive within 2 seconds
And pass Core Web Vitals thresholds

Example:
  Given the project dashboard page
  When loading on mobile device
  Then LCP should be <2.5 seconds
  And CLS should be <0.1
  And FID should be <100ms
```

#### Scenario: Interaction Responsiveness  
```gherkin
Given any interactive element
When user performs an action (click, type, scroll)
Then feedback should be provided within 100ms
And the action should complete within 1 second
And loading states should be shown for longer operations

Example:
  Given a project creation form
  When user clicks "Create Project" button
  Then button should show loading state immediately
  And success/error feedback should appear within 3 seconds
```

### Feature: Zero-Downtime Migration
As a product owner
I want seamless migration with no service interruption
So that users can continue working without disruption

#### Scenario: Gradual Feature Rollout
```gherkin
Given a new feature slice is ready for deployment
When deploying to production
Then the feature should be behind a feature flag initially
And rolled out gradually to user segments  
And monitored for performance impact
And easily rolled back if issues occur

Example:
  Given the new project dashboard widget
  When deploying to production
  Then 10% of users should see the new widget initially
  And error rates should be monitored
  And automatic rollback should trigger if errors >2%
```

#### Scenario: Database Migration Safety
```gherkin
Given database schema changes are needed
When running migrations
Then migrations should be backward compatible
And rollback scripts should be tested
And data integrity should be validated
And zero downtime should be maintained

Example:
  Given adding a new field to projects table
  When deploying the migration
  Then old application version should continue working
  And new field should have sensible defaults
  And rollback should restore exact previous state
```
