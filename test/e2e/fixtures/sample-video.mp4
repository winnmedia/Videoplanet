# Sample Video File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the sample video file used in E2E tests.
In a real scenario, you would place an actual MP4 video file here.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Use a small sample video (< 1MB)
2. Create a mock video file
3. Use a public domain video

The video should be:
- Format: MP4
- Duration: 30-60 seconds
- Resolution: 720p or lower (for faster testing)
- Size: < 5MB
